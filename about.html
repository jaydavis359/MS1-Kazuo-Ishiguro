            <p>
                Sir Kazuo Ishiguro is a British novelist, screenwriter and short-story writer. He was born in
                Nagasaki,
                Japan.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ishiguro is one of the most celebrated contemporary fiction authors in the English-speaking world.
                He
                has received four Man Booker Prize nominations and won the award in 1989 for his novel The Remains
                of
                the Day. Ishiguro's 2005 novel, Never Let Me Go, was named by Time as the best novel of the year and
                was
                included in the magazine's list of the 100 best English-language novels published between 1923 and
                2005.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2017, the Swedish Academy awarded Ishiguro the Nobel Prize in Literature, describing him in its
                citation as a writer "who, in novels of great emotional force, has uncovered the abyss beneath our
                illusory sense of connection with the world"
            </p>
            <p>
                Ishiguro was born in Nagasaki, Japan, on 8 November 1954, the son of Shizuo Ishiguro, a physical
                oceanographer, and his wife, Shizuko. At the age of five, Ishiguro and his family left Japan and
                moved
                to Guildford, Surrey, as his father was invited for research at the National Institute of
                Oceanography
                (now the National Oceanography Centre). He did not return to visit Japan until 1989, nearly 30 years
                later, when he was a participant in the Japan Foundation Short-Term Visitors' Program.
                In an interview with Kenzaburō Ōe, Ishiguro stated that the Japanese settings of his first two
                novels
                were imaginary: "I grew up with a very strong image in my head of this other country, a very
                important
                other country to which I had a strong emotional tie… In England I was all the time building up this
                picture in my head, an imaginary Japan."
            </p>
            <p>
                Ishiguro, who has been described as a British Asian author, explained in a BBC interview how growing
                up
                in a Japanese family in the UK was crucial to his writing, enabling him to see things from a
                different
                perspective to that of many of his English peers.
                He attended Stoughton Primary School and then Woking County Grammar School in Surrey. After
                finishing
                school, he took a gap year and travelled through the United States and Canada, all the while writing
                a
                journal and sending demo tapes to record companies.
                In 1974, he began studies at the University of Kent at Canterbury, graduating in 1978 with a
                Bachelor of
                Arts(honours) in English and philosophy. After spending a year writing fiction, he resumed his
                studies
                at the University of East Anglia where he studied with Malcolm Bradbury and Angela Carter, and
                gained a
                Master of Arts in creative writing in 1980. His thesis became his first novel, A Pale View of Hills,
                published in 1982.
                He became a UK citizen in 1983.
